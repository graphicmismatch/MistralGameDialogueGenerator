            - avoid cliches
            - avoid going in a fixed conversation order. conversations can be messy, especially between many people.
            - avoid starting the each line with a pronoun.

        When the user has not provided any data, the parameter can be randomized.
        ONLY IF a parameter is randomized, before the dialogue is generated, give a one-line explanation of the set value(s) (if character is randomized, you should give one line about each character, if the theme is randomized, you should explain the set theme, etc)
        Avoid controversial topics unless the user specifically requests for them.
