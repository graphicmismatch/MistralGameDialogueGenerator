# app.py

app.py is the frontend built in streamlit.

## UI

The UI consists of 3 tabs which encapsulate the 3 scenarios this project attempts to cover:

- Tab 1 handles the Dialogue Generation for Casual Game Developers
- Tab 2 handles the Dialogue Generation for Professional Game Developers
- Tab 3 handles content generation for Game Reviewers and Influencers.

## Technical Details

The frontend uses streamlit forms to take input data and uses a function "display_callback" to display the output.
